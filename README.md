This is an extremely easy to use/quick way to delete temporary Windows files that take up storage space.
You can either simply run the .bat file, or you can follow these steps so it runs on Windows startup.


RUN ON WINDOWS BOOTUP
---------------------------------
1. Press Windows Key + R
2. Type shell:startup
3. Click enter
4. Drag the cleanup.bat file into this folder, and you are done! Simple as that.


Hope this is a useful tool for some of you who struggle with temporary files taking up storage.
Temporary files can be extremely obnoxious and so this helps automate deleting these files.
